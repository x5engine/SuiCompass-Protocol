# 🚀 MVP Features: SuiCompass Protocol
**Response to Accelerator Milestone**

**Product Vision**: The "AI-Native OS" for Sui DeFi—turning natural language into verifiable onchain wealth creation.

---

### 1. Review & Selection (The "Golden Nuggets")
Based on our development progress and the "Voice of the Customer" (DeFi users tired of fragmentation), we have identified three core pillars that provide immediate, unique value:

1.  **The "Intent Engine" (AI Chat)**: Solving the "how do I do this?" friction.
2.  **Unified Control Plane (Dashboard)**: Solving the "where is my money?" fragmentation.
3.  **One-Click Execution (Staking)**: Solving the "too many clicks" fatigue.

*Note: While we have developed advanced features like RWA Tokenization and D3 Graphs, these are "Delighters" for V2. The MVP must prove the AI-to-Blockchain thesis first.*

### 2. Capabilities & Success Capabilities

| MVP Feature | Capability Description | Success Metric (KPI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. AI Intent Copilot** | **Input**: "Stake my SUI" <br> **Output**: A ready-to-sign transaction block. <br> *Demonstrates unique AI parsing of DeFi intent.* | **Conversion Rate**: % of chats that result in a signed transaction (>30%). |
| **2. Real-time Staking** | **Capability**: Fetch Validator APYs from onchain state, rank them, and route stake to the best one. <br> *Demonstrates protocol-level optimization.* | **TVL (Total Value Locked)**: Amount of SUI staked through the platform. |
| **3. Portfolio OS** | **Capability**: Aggregated view of Wallet Balances + Active Stakes in one "Sui Blue" interface. <br> *Demonstrates "Single Pane of Glass" value.* | **Retention**: Daily Active Users (DAU) checking portfolio >3x/week. |

### 3. Feasibility Analysis

| Feature | Technical Complexity | Status | Verdict |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **AI Intent Engine** | High (EmbedAPI integration) | ✅ **Done** | **IN (Core)** |
| **Native Staking** | Medium (Sui SDK) | ✅ **Done** | **IN (Utility)** |
| **SuiNS Resolution**| Low (SDK helper) | ✅ **Done** | **IN (Polish)** |
| **RWA Tokenizer** | High (Move Contracts) | 🎨 **UI Only** | **OUT (Post-MVP)** |
| **D3 Token Graph** | High (Data Viz) | 🧪 **Beta** | **OUT (Post-MVP)** |
| **CLI Tool** | Medium (Node.js) | 🚧 **WIP** | **OUT (Dev Tool)** |

*Assessment: We are well within timeline constraints as the "High Complexity" Core (AI Engine) is already stable.*

### 4. The MVP Definition (Down-Selected List)

For our Beta launch / Accelerator Demo Day, the **SuiCompass MVP** consists of:

1.  **Chat Interface**: The primary input method. Users must be able to type an intent and get a transaction.
2.  **Smart Staking Agent**: The primary use case. "Find me the best yield and stake."
3.  **Wallet Dashboard**: The feedback loop. Visual confirmation that the action happened.
4.  **Auto-Connect**: Essential UX to prevent repeated logins (Session Persistence).

**Excluded from MVP:**
-   Complex RWA flows (Real estate minting).
-   Advanced D3 Visualizations (kept as "Hidden Gems" for investor demos only).
-   CLI usage (focus on Mass Market Web experience).

### 5. Why this wins
By narrowing our focus to **"Chat -> Stake -> Track"**, we prove the core thesis: *AI makes DeFi easier.* We avoid the trap of building a generic wallet or a generic chat bot. We are building an **Agent**.
