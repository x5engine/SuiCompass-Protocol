# February Week 3: Protocol Mainnet Launch & Feature Completion

**Dates:** February 15, 2026 - February 21, 2026 (Current)

## 🎯 Weekly Goal
Scale the protocol to a full DeFi ecosystem, overhaul the user experience for production, and launch the comprehensive SuiCompass suite on Mainnet.

## 🏆 Key Achievements

### 1. 🚀 Mainnet Launch: The "Top-Notch" 11-Contract Ecosystem
We successfully deployed a unified package containing **11 advanced DeFi modules**, transforming SuiCompass from a simple agent into a full-scale financial operating system.
*   **New Primitives:** `portfolio` (AI-Managed), `index_fund` (ETF), `flash_loan` (Arbitrage), `lossless_lottery`, `derivatives`, `stream_pay`, `reputation_id`.
*   **Move 2024:** Refactored entire codebase to the latest Sui Move 2024 standards.
*   **Production Deployment:** All contracts are live and verifiable on Sui Mainnet.

### 2. 🌐 Production Showcase: [SuiCompass.com](https://suicompass.com)
The official gateway to the SuiCompass ecosystem is now live!
*   **Live App:** **[https://suicompass.com](https://suicompass.com)** (Experience the full "Sui Blue" interface).
*   **Full-Stack UI/UX Transformation:** Evolved from a chat interface into a comprehensive dApp with dedicated views: `/market`, `/games`, `/assets`, and `/profile`.
*   **Immersive Experience:** Premium glassmorphic design system with cinematic animations, real-time D3.js token graphs, and integrated sound effects for a truly "Sui-native" feel.

### 3. 🧠 AI Brain Level-Up
*   **Move Philosophy Injection:** The AI now understands the underlying object-centric architecture of Sui.
*   **Autonomous Complexity:** The agent can now construct Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTBs) for complex operations like Flash Loans, ETF rebalancing, and Cross-chain bridging.
*   **Discovery Engine:** Added a dynamic sidebar that proactively suggests advanced DeFi strategies to users.
