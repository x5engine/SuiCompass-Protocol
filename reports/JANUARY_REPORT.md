## January Work Summary

January was dedicated to **deep research and architectural planning** for SuiCompass. Rather than rushing to commit incomplete code, I focused on:

1. **Understanding Sui Deeply**: Studied the Sui documentation, SDK patterns, and best practices to ensure the implementation would be production-grade.

2. **Designing the "Intent Engine"**: Researched how to bridge natural language understanding with Sui's transaction model, designing the architecture for zero-UI DeFi operations.

3. **Planning the x402 Agent**: Designed the autonomous monitoring and yield optimization algorithm that would become the core differentiator.

4. **Creating the Design System**: Developed the "Sui Blue" aesthetic and component architecture to ensure the final product would feel premium.

This month laid the **foundation** for the rapid, high-quality implementation executed in February.
