## 📅 Monthly Report: The Build
**Focus:** Execution & Architecture

We went from whiteboards to a fully functional dApp in 4 weeks.

*   **Core Engine**: Built a robust client-side application using `@mysten/dapp-kit` and React 19, optimized for high-frequency RPC interaction.
*   **AI Layer**: Engineered a custom "Intent Parser" using `@embedapi/core` that translates user goals ("Max yield please") into ready-to-sign Transaction Blocks.
*   **Visual Identity**: Crafted the **"Sui Blue"** design system to define the visual language of the next generation of DeFi apps.

**Outcome**: A polished, high-performance DeFi OS that feels like it belongs in 2026.

## 🗓️ Weekly Report: "Polish & Power"
**Focus:** x402 Agent & VFX

This week we focused on the "Secret Sauce" features:

*   **x402 Auto Agent ("The Robot")**:
    *   We didn't just want a dashboard; we wanted an employee. The **x402 Module** runs in the background, monitoring wallet health and effective APY.
    *   **Immersive UX**: Added "Epic" sound design and particle effects to gamify the DeFi experience.
*   **Advanced Visualization**:
    *   Implemented **D3.js** integration to render complex asset relationships as interactive nodes.
    *   Upgraded the "Compass" sidebar to be context-aware, guiding the user through complex flows.
